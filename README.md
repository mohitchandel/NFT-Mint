# NFT-Mint

There are 3 NFT (Non Fungible Token) standard are used:
- ERC721
- ERC721A
- ERC1155

## ERC721
The ERC-721 introduces a standard for NFT, in other words, this type of Token is unique and can have a different value than another Token from the same Smart Contract, maybe due to its age, rarity, or even something else like its visual.

Token created on ERC721 standard -> [0x0d54c589f0e69b672eaab60c938b6bdab065af21](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x0d54c589f0e69b672eaab60c938b6bdab065af21)

First transfer Transaction -> https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0xb63c3f66321c9d57ec890d92154310e0a85dff20a21826672dd47de6eb382009

## ERC721A
The goal of ERC721A is to provide a fully compliant implementation of IERC721 with significant gas savings for minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction. This project and implementation will be updated regularly and will continue to stay up to date with best practices.

Token created on ERC721A standard -> [0xaf0ead74d3860f2b0f9a51828aa20e91b8603d91](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0xaf0ead74d3860f2b0f9a51828aa20e91b8603d91)

First transfer Transaction -> https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0xa45d6cccd5bcc0727e3c8dbb1eb160acb190619502220270d7f05488d7774319

## ERC1155
A standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens) or smart contract interface that can represent and control any number of fungible and non-fungible token types

Token created on ERC721A standard -> [0x8c513097a750f381acbb6f897b7384a6ac7d6b74](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x8c513097a750f381acbb6f897b7384a6ac7d6b74)

First transfer Transaction -> https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0xe1320aa84e77c0538793b0c2cdd5807519a26d9113e36bf96441def431fce807
